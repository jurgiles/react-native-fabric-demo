# react-native-fabric-demo
Example for testing out React Native's New Fabric Architecture

```
yarn install
yarn react-native run-android
```
Enabling fabric in the RN sample happens through setting `newArchEnabled=true` as shown in [307ce25000a62abb6e68e061e54a6cdc60203b5e](https://github.com/jurgiles/react-native-fabric-demo/commit/307ce25000a62abb6e68e061e54a6cdc60203b5e)

The Metro Bundler will confirm that Fabric is running with the `"fabric": true` log:
```
 Running "ReactNativeFabricDemo" with {"fabric":true,"initialProps":{},"rootTag":1}
 ```
